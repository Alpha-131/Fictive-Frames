# Fictive Frames: Text-to-Image Generation

* NOTE  : Our project is still under work. Will update the codebase soon.

## Overview
This repository hosts the code for our IPD project, Fictive Frames, focused on text-to-image generation. Our goal is to develop an efficient model that translates textual descriptions into visually compelling images.

## Key Features
- **Innovative Approach**: We combine variational autoencoders (VAE), text embeddings, transformers, and UNET architecture for image generation.
- **Simplicity & Efficiency**: Emphasis on minimizing parameters while maintaining image quality for faster training and inference.
- **Streamlined Solution**: Designed to facilitate content creation by automating image production from natural language inputs.

## Project Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Survey existing models in text-to-image generation.
2. **Dataset Compilation**: Gather a diverse dataset of textual descriptions and corresponding images.
3. **Model Development**: Propose an innovative model integrating computer vision and NLP techniques.
4. **Performance Validation**: Validate and optimize the model's performance.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establish unbiased metrics for rigorous assessment.
6. **User Studies**: Conduct user studies to gauge effectiveness and user experience.

## Motivation
Driven by the increasing demand for multimedia content, our project aims to streamline the image creation process, reducing time and resources while enhancing engagement and creativity.
